features:
  - title: Low-Rank Adaptation
    details: Adopts low-rank adaptation instead of resource-demanding fine-tuning, efficiently adapting ViT models with minimal additional parameters.
  - title: Multi-Task Capability
    details: Enables the development of a single CAD model for multiple clinical tasks, supporting various diagnosis tasks across different imaging modalities.
  - title: Storage Efficiency
    details: Adds only about 0.5MB of storage space, making it highly efficient in terms of storage requirements.
  - title: Fast Model Switching
    details: Allows for extremely fast model switching in deployment and inference, enhancing real-world usability.
  - title: High Performance
    details: Achieves competitive results on various diagnosis tasks using only a few trainable parameters, comparable to fully fine-tuned ViT models.
  - title: Lightweight Solution
    details: Provides a lightweight solution for developing CAD models, addressing challenges such as limited storage space and time-consuming model switching.
