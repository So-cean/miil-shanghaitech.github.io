The dataset comprises thousands of knee X-ray and MRI images, along with clinical data collected from men and women across various stages of OA. This extensive dataset is invaluable for researchers aiming to understand the progression of knee osteoarthritis, develop diagnostic tools, and evaluate potential treatments.
